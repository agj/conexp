Concatenative expressions, written in Javascript. An extremely simple syntax for defining embedded languages, for use with [Node][node].

It takes [postfix code](#the-syntax) using functions you define, like `3 4 + 5 *`, and executes it to an array containing values, in this case `[35]` (the result of (3 + 4) * 5).

By default works asynchronously (using promises), but also comes with a synchronous mode.

## Example

```js
const conexp = require('conexp');

// First let's define some functions for our language.
const add = (a, b) => [a + b];
const subtract = (a, b) => [a - b];
const multiply = (a, b) => [a * b];
const divide = (a, b) => [a / b];

// Then let's generate it.
const evaluate = conexp({ '+': add, '-': subtract, '*': multiply, '/': divide });

// Now to test it.
evaluate('1 2 +');          //=> Promise([3])
evaluate('10 4 - 3 /');     //=> Promise([3])
evaluate('10 5 4 2 / - *'); //=> Promise([30])
```

For synchronous evaluation, just require `'conexp/sync'`, like this:

```js
const conexp = require('conexp/sync');
// ...
evaluate('1 2 +'); //=> [3]
```



## Installation

With [Node][node] installed, type into the command line:

```sh
npm install conexp
```


## The syntax

The language evaluates [**postfix notation**][postfix] expressions. This is unlike Javascript functions, which come before (and wrap) their arguments, and unlike math operators (such as `+`,) which come in between their arguments. Indeed, in our case, the functions/operators come _after_ the arguments. Like `3 2 +` or `"Hello world" print`.

Execution order is from left to right. It is performed by keeping a **stack** (basically a list) into which we push and pull values. Plain values are _pushed_ into the stack.

Let's take the previous _Example_ section's last line's expression and start analyzing it step by step. This is the expression:

`10 5 4 2 / - *`

The first four tokens `10 5 4 2` push four values into the stack, namely `10`, `5`, `4`, and `2`. So our stack and remainder of the expression look like this:

`[ 10 5 4 2 ] / - *` (The stack is in `[]` brackets.)

Next we have the function `/`. This, by its definition in the javascript code above, takes two values and returns one. This means that it _pops_ the last two values from the stack and operates on them, and then _pushes_ the result, the division of 4 by 2 (that is, 2) into the stack.

`[ 10 5 2 ] - *`

Where `4 2` used to be now there's `2`, the result of their division. Next we have `-`, which does a similar thing: it evaluates the subtraction of 5 and 2, namely 3.

`[ 10 3 ] *`

And finally, the last operation.

`[ 30 ]`

Thus the result of evaluating the entire expression is an array containing the single value `30`.

The syntax used is an elementary example of what is known as [_concatenative programming_][wiki-concat]. In essence, the above is all there is and all you need to knowâ€”it's quite simple. However, if you wanna delve deeper into the esoterica behind the concatenative approach, you may read [John Purdy's _Why concatenative programming matters_][purdy], browse the [concatenative.org wiki][concat-org], or read [Brent Kerby's _The theory of concatenative combinators_][kerby].


## Defining functions

Functions may take any number of arguments, and **must** either return an array containing any number of return values, or a promise that returns one (when in asynchronous mode). The arguments it receives are _popped_ from the stack, and the values it returns are _pushed_ into it. In the _Example_ section we see functions defined for several arithmetic operations. Here you have a few other types of possible functions:

```js
const conexp = require('conexp');

// Output.
const log = a => {
    console.log(a);
    return [a];
};

// Combinators.
const dup = a => [a, a];
const swap = (a, b) => [b, a];
const drop = a => [];

const evaluate = conexp({ log, dup, swap, drop });

evaluate('"Hello world!" log'); //=> Promise(['Hello world!'])
                                // and will output the string to the console.
evaluate('1 2 swap drop dup');  //=> Promise([2, 2])
```


## Generating and using the language

Import the module in either asynchronous or synchronous mode:

```js
require('conexp')      // Asynchronous (using promises)
require('conexp/sync') // Synchronous
```

Define all the functions usable within your language in an object `functions`. Each key/value pair in this object should indicate an identifier/function relationship within the language that will be generated.

> `const functions = { identifier1: function1 /*, ... */ }`

Pass this object to the `conexp` function.

> `const evaluate = conexp(functions)`

The result of calling the `conexp` function is an `evaluate` function that takes in a string `expression`. It evaluates it, calling the functions you supplied when appropriate, and returns the array of values it produces.

> `const result = evaluate(expression)`

The `expression` should, of course, be formatted according to the syntax described in this document. `result` will in this case be a promise that resolves into an array of values, or if using the synchronous mode, directly to said array.


## Current limitations

The syntax **does** support the following features:

- Strings such as: `'hi'`, `"it's OK"`
- Numbers such as `5`, `1.3`, `-800.17`
- Booleans: `true` or `false`
- Functions.

It **does not** yet support anything else, like:

- Quotations (grouping tokens for later parsing, necessary for branching, etc.).
- Definitions.

I will get around to some of these in the future.
